Case Study, boiii

Repo should include a copy of your .sql database

TO DO:

Pics-
  step_XXX.png
  ingredients.png
  beauty_pic.png

Fix data to look better (no more ?s on ingredients + steps)

Check pages to see if data is input correctly (some don't have step names, which can break my formatting) + 'cr�me fra�che', '475�F'

Add filters for recipes to SQL + add functionality of filters to site

Ensure ppl can't insert SQL into the search tab or anything to break my DB

EXTRA CREDIT:

Insert CMS structure

Allow people to add or remove steps, and auto-format it
