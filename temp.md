Note that says I did Extra Credit + In-Depth (able to add / remove indiv. steps)

Case Study, boiii

TO DO:

Add functionality of filters to site

Use JS for this shit maybe? Should be easier than AJAX. Wait... that's what AJAX is, dummy!

Use DISPLAY: NONE + AJAX for displaying shit

Keep display: none; in a class named Hidden

On click, toggle a function that checks if an el has class "Hidden" to remove need for conditional checker var

Possibly make Search automatically show up on pg (this would also use AJAX, but would require me to rewrite whole search pg)

EXTRA CREDIT:

Insert CMS structure

Allow people to add or remove steps, and auto-format it

mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $query_result) for ALL updates

Auto-format / rename pictures

Checkboxes for Filters Add + Remove, Adds "Filter\" to DB
