Repo should include a copy of your .sql database

TO DO:

Pics-
  step_XXX.png
  ingredients.png
  recipe_header.png
  beauty_pic.png

Fix data to look better (no more ?s on ingredients + steps)

Check pages to see if data is input correctly (some don't have step names, which can break my formatting)

Add filters to SQL + add functionality to site

Make 2019 auto-update to current year
